## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (first time working without ReactJS)

### What I learned

I learned a lot with this very simple exercise, as it's the first time I've gotten away from CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind, and JavaScript frameworks like ReactJS.

These screens were developed using CSS3 and JavaScript for DOM manipulation. There is a lot of room for improvement, but I'm happy with the results achieved.

### Continued development

I hope to revisit this code and refactor it as my CSS skills improve.
